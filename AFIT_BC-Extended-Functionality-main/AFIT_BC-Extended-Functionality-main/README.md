## Project Naming Convention

### Follow a Numbering Range Convention

Specific number ranges for different object types (pages, tables, reports, etc.).

Any Object: 50100 - 50300

### Use Meaningful Object Names

Use names that clearly describe the purpose of the object. This makes it easier to understand the codebase.

### Consistent Naming Conventions

    New Object File Name Pattern": "<ObjectTypeShort><ObjectId>.<ObjectName(PascalCase)>.al",
    Extended Object File Name Pattern: "<ObjectTypeShort>-Ext<ObjectId>.<ObjectName(PascalCase)>.al"

Use a consistent naming convention such as CamelCase or PascalCase for object names and variable names.

### Use Comments and Documentation

Add comments to explain the purpose of objects and any complex logic.
Documentation: Maintain documentation for your extensions, including a description of object IDs, naming conventions, and any special rules.
